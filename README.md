## Pokemon API React Rebuild

## Used code and layout from https://github.com/et120 as a guide. I used Elizabeth's project as a guide as I was confused as to how certain things worked and how she got certain things to happen in her project that I haden't seen anyone else do.  

## Create a single page pokemon application using the Pokemon API and React TypeScript

## Peer Review:  It looks great and it works, the only things are the favorites you cant click on the name to bring you to that pokemon but i dont think that was required. also the search has to be in lowercase to work but other than that it woks great and looks great
